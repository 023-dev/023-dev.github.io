title: "focus and hustle"

I am a software engineer who is passionate about building things and solving problems.
And I pursue raw intelligence. I believe that the best way to learn is to learn from the best.
I have a strong background in Java and Spring Framework, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools.
